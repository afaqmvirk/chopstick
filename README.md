# chopstick

## what

chopstick is an app suite that exists to build as many chopstick-themed apps as possible

## methodology

we believe that quantity > quality. we want to create as much chopstick as possible, even if that means sacrificing quality of apps

we will take an approach of using the bare minimum at any given moment. for example, if a website can be done just as easily with vanilla HTML, we will not use next.js
